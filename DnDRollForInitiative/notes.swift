 PRIORITY:
 Has to be easier and more convenient than using pen and paper for battles with large numbers of characters

 
 
 GENERAL MECHANICS:
- Add names, initiative, hitpoints, AC
- If multiple initiative rolls are the same, then add dex
- If dex is same, give choice
- Add new characters halfway through battle (if initiative is same, goes through same handling process if clashes with another character)
- Temporarily/permanently remove characters from battle
- Way to instantly remove/add hitpoints to/from any character
- Status effects (text next to names such as concentration, frightened, poisoned - just add custom text next to name)
- Option to show all characters, stats (and initiative?)  Need to know for status effects
