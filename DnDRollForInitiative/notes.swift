 PRIORITY:
 Has to be easier and more convenient than using pen and paper for battles with large numbers of characters

 
 
 GENERAL MECHANICS:
- Add names, initiative, hitpoints, AC
- If multiple initiative rolls are the same, then add dex
- If dex is same, give choice
- Add new characters halfway through battle (if initiative is same, goes through same handling process if clashes with another character)
- Temporarily/permanently remove characters from battle
- Way to instantly remove/add hitpoints to/from any character
- Status effects (text next to names such as concentration, frightened, poisoned - just add custom text next to name)
- Option to show all characters, stats (and initiative?)  Need to know for status effects
 

 
 KNOWN BUGS:

 
 
 TO MODIFY:
 
 New Mechanics:
 - Way to permanently delete a character out of the charOrdered list if a mistake has been made
 
 Modified Mechanics:
 HP

 - option to delete a character entirely if mistakes are made?
 - or option to modify its stats directly?
 
 
 Confirmation
 - If y/n for confirmation not entered, needs to re-show the confirmation prompt
 otherwise I don't know whether my input has been received or it's still waiting
 

 
 when a character goes to 0 hp, only the status unconscious is recorded and not
 the losing of the hp to that stage
 
 
 - if remove status with whitespace after, doesn't recognise.
 
 - adding and removing HP.  If name + 8 or name - 2 entered, doesn't work.
