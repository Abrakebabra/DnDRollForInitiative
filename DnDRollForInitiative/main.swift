//  add names, initiative, hitpoints, AC
//  If multiple initiative rolls are the same, then add dex
//  If dex is same, then give choice
//  Way to add new characters halfway through battle (if initiative is same, goes through same handling process if clashes with another character)
//  Way to temporarily/permanently remove characters from battle
//  Way to instantly remove/add hitpoints to/from any character
//  Status effects (text next to names such as concentration, frightened, poisoned - just add Kelsey's custom text next to name)
//  Option to show all characters, stats (and initiative?)  Need to know for status effects
//  [current character turns] [next set character turns, new characters introduced here]



//  help = show available commands
//  all = show all characters, order, stats,
//  add = new characters (and check)




/*
 Bugs:
  - Adding first character, stats don't show
 

 
 
 
 To re-design/modify:
  - output printlines not so great to read
  - new character entry is confusing to use.  Prompts might be better
  - add option for quick entry without prompts
  - after modifying, should display everything again with updated stats
  - making changes such as HP, needs a change confirmed printline
  - are all the confirmations necessary?
  - option to delete a character entirely if mistakes are made?
  - or option to modify its stats directly?
  - If y/n for confirmation not entered, needs to re-show the confirmation prompt
    otherwise I don't know whether my input has been received or it's still waiting
